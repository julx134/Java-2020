These are the java projects I will be coding for Winter 2020. There are two key distinguishable features of this repo.
--> 1) I will be using GIT to manage my projects (version control) while I am working on it in order to simulate
	real-life experience.
--> 2) I will be following various major concepts as outline in COE528 such as SDLC, Abstraction,
	Requirements Analysis and Elicitation and System and Object Design.
